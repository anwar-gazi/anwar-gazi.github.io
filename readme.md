# Engineering Case Study Portfolio

This repository is a **single, focused portfolio** of real-world engineering work across multiple industries — from **GovTech and fintech** to **media, logistics, telephony, ecommerce, and infrastructure (IIG)**.

Each case study is a **standalone, beautifully formatted HTML page** with:

- Business context & constraints  
- Architecture & implementation highlights  
- Impact on revenue, reliability, or operations  
- Optional charts / visuals you can plug in later  

The `index.html` file acts as a **landing page** that lists and links to all of them, with light interactivity (industry filters) and a clean, recruiter-friendly layout.

## Quick Start

1. Clone or download this repo.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click or drag-drop into Chrome/Firefox).
3. Click on any card to open the corresponding case study page.
4. Use the **“Browse by industry focus”** filter pills on the landing page to narrow down the list by domain.

If hosting on GitHub Pages / Netlify / Vercel, simply point them at this folder — the landing page will automatically work as your public portfolio.
